## This is a simple project that utilizes HTML Geolocation API and MapBox API

This Project Reflects a Mock Drone Delivery Company
Clicking the "Check Location" button will prompt the user for location services and adjust pin location accordingly

Below the MapBox there is a service status string that will notify the user if the location is found
(will always say yes if location is accepted)
